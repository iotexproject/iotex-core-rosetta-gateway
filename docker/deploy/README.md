## Running IoTeX node and Rosetta gateway in a Docker

This setup is for running IoTeX mainnet node with Rosetta only.

Please put the `etc` in this directory under your local data path:
```bash
cp -rf ./etc {YOUR_LOCAL_DATA_PATH}
```

Port `8080` is rosetta gateway port, and port `4689` is IoTeX node p2p port.

- If you are running the node behind a reverse proxy, it is suggested to set the reverse proxy external IP address in `etc/iotex/config_override.yaml` `externalHost` field. 
- If you like to use your own private key instead of randomly assigned one, you can also set it in `etc/iotex/config_override.yaml` `producerPrivKey` field.

To build the docker image:
```bash
docker build . -t iotex/iotex-core-rosetta

```

You can also find the built image here: `iotex/iotex-core-rosetta:latest`

To run the docker image in online mode:
```bash
docker run -v {YOUR_LOCAL_DATA_PATH}:/data -p 8080:8080 -p 4689:4689 -it iotex/iotex-core-rosetta
```

To run in offline mode which runs gateway only in container without chain node:
```bash
docker run -v {YOUR_LOCAL_DATA_PATH}:/data -p 8080:8080 -it iotex/iotex-core-rosetta iotex-core-rosetta-gateway
```

Once your node starts syncing, you can check with `rosetta-cli@v0.4.1` with following command:
```bash
cd ../../rosetta-cli-config
rosetta-cli check:data --configuration-file mainnet/iotex.json
```
